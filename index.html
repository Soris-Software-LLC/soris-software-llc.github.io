            To all our clients, colleagues, and employees
        </p>
        <p>
            It is with a heavy heart that we've made the decision to close our doors here at Soris Software. Over the past seven years, we've enjoyed the opportunity to get to know you and to work with you to build your business. Together, we've made some incredible products.
        </p>
        <p>
            We never could have done it without you.
        </p>
        <p>
            For that, we want to say thank you.
        </p>
