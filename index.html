        <p>
            To all our clients, colleagues, and employees
        </p>
        <p>
            It is with a heavy heart that I'm announcing my decision to close the doors here at Soris Software. Since we started in 2014, we've had the opportunity to work with great clients. Despite the potential for many exciting projects, the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged us to reevaluate our operations. In the end, we decided the right option for our employees and our clients is to close down and pursue new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I'll be moving on to a developer management role at another company. I'll also be working with our staff to help them find the right opportunities for them, and I will be working with current clients to refer them to fantastic developers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We've enjoyed the opportunity to get to know you and to work with you to build your business. Together, we've made some incredible products.
        </p>
        <p>
            We never could have done it without you.
        </p>
        <p>
            For that, we want to say thank you.
        </p>
